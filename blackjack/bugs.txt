BlackJack has an Alert message, and does not disable buttons, bc the disable happens in stand() function

If player reaches 21, automatically stand

Player AND dealer get bj

Player stands on 14 with no hit. Dealer has 15, hits to 25, wins...

Remove Alert Message when dealer draws bj

 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* How to handle Aces ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
Facts:
By default, the Ace is worth 11. If the score is greater than 10, Ace becomes 1.
You can only have 1 Ace = 11.



 if the array includes more than 1 ace:

If ace, check score, add 11.
If another ace, check if an ace already exists, value by default =1;
If new ace + old ace create over 21, then first ace = 1.

Run through 
 var success = array_a.every(function(val) {
    return array_b.indexOf(val) !== -1;
});






Brian's Method:
If player > 21
proceed to run a check of Aces. Save the player from busting by changing the value of the Ace
Use Player Ace score to keep track of how many points you have from Aces, also serves as an easy check if you have an ace

--Inside 'Hit()'
if(hitCard.value=='Ace'){
    if(this.playerScore <= 10{
        this.playerScore +=11
        this.playerAceScore += 11
    } else {//Score is already too high
        this.playerScore += 1
        this.playerAceScore += 1
    }
}else {
    this.playerScore += hitCard.numVal
}



Dwyer Method
Map through array, search for a numVal of 11, and change to 1
